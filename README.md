## Introduction

Redux is a predictable state management library for JavaScript applications. It helps manage the state of your application in a centralized store, making it easier to debug and maintain. This project uses **Redux Toolkit**, the official, recommended way to write Redux logic, to simplify the setup and usage of Redux.

## Fundamental Concepts of Redux

### 1. Store

The **store** is the central repository of the application's state. It holds the entire state tree and provides methods to access, update, and listen to state changes.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Holds the application state.
- Allows access via `store.getState()`.
- Allows updates via `store.dispatch(action)`.
- Registers listeners via `store.subscribe(listener)`.

---

### 2. Actions

**Actions** are plain JavaScript objects that describe **what happened**. They must have a `type` property and can include a `payload` for additional data.

**Example**:

```javascript
{
  type: 'INCREMENT',
  payload: 1
}
```

**Key Points**:

- Dispatched to trigger state changes.
- Describe **what** happened, not **how** the state changes.

---

### 3. Reducers

**Reducers** are pure functions that specify **how** the state changes in response to actions. They take the current state and an action, then return the new state.

**Example**:

```javascript
const counterReducer = (state = { value: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return { value: state.value + action.payload };
    case "DECREMENT":
      return { value: state.value - action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

**Key Points**:

- Must be pure (no side effects).
- Determine how state changes based on action.

---

### 4. Dispatch

The **dispatch** function sends an action to the store. The reducer processes the action and returns a new state.

**Example**:

```javascript
store.dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT", payload: 1 });
```

**Key Points**:

- Triggers the reducer to update state.
- The only way to change state in Redux.

---

### 5. Selectors

**Selectors** are functions that extract specific pieces of state from the store.

**Example**:

```javascript
const selectCounterValue = (state) => state.counter.value;
```

**Key Points**:

- Reusable state-selection logic.
- Improve code clarity and maintainability.

---

### 6. Middleware

**Middleware** provides an extension point between dispatching an action and the reducer handling it.

**Example**: `redux-thunk` for async logic.

**Key Points**:

- Used for logging, crash reporting, async flows, etc.

---

### 7. Async Actions

Async operations in Redux are handled via middleware like **redux-thunk** or **redux-saga**.

**Example with redux-thunk**:

```javascript
const fetchData = () => async (dispatch) => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/data");
  const data = await response.json();
  dispatch({ type: "DATA_LOADED", payload: data });
};
```

**Key Points**:

- Dispatch actions after async tasks complete.
- Useful for API calls and side effects.

---

## Advantages of Redux

- Centralized state management
- Predictable state updates
- Easy debugging with Redux DevTools
- Scalable for large applications

---

## Redux Toolkit

**Redux Toolkit (RTK)** simplifies Redux development by providing batteries-included utilities.

**Key Features**:

- `configureStore`: Simplifies store setup with good defaults.
- `createSlice`: Bundles reducers and action creators.
- `createAsyncThunk`: Simplifies writing async actions.
